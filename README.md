# My prompt for bash

These files allow to have:
- `my.prompt.bash` - a nice prompt with time, path and **git branch**
- `pushbullet.bash` - simple PushBullet notification on your phone from command line
- `long.command.bash` - a notice about the execution time after each command longer then ..., and a PushBullet notification for commands longer then ...

Best. Prompt. Ever.
